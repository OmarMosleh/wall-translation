                Before you retire, teach him about what has been said in the past;
Then he will be an example to the children of the nobles,
When understanding and precision have entered into him.
Instruct him, for no one is born wise.
If a nobleman takes to heart what is said by his father,
Never will fail any endeavor of his.
Educate your son as a listener.
One who will be esteemed in the hearts of the nobles,
One who guides his speech in accordance with what is said to him,
One who acknowledges him who is to be obeyed.
            </p>
            <p>It is such a son who is superior and whose actions are distinguished,
                But error is ingrained into him who does not listen.
                The education of a wise man (leads) to his success,
                But as for the fool, he will labor (in vain).
                As for the fool who will not listen,
                He never accomplishes anything,
                For his discerns knowledge in ignorance
                And something beneficial in that which is baneful.</p>
